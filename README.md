# Programing-2-project

As of today this project is old, from 04/04/2021, but it displays the fact that I am growing as a programmer.

Program Description:

This program asks the user for input, validates the input, and then instantiates student objects with the input. It stores them in a LinkedList, and then uses a programer defined Comparator to sort the student objects by name. Finally, it uses the programer defined toString method to output the objects to a file in a predictable manner.
